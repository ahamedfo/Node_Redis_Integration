ws is a simple to use, blazing fast, and thoroughly tested WebSocket client and
server implementation.

Passes the quite extensive Autobahn test suite: [server][server-report],
[client][client-report].

**Note**: This module does not work in the browser. The client in the docs is a
reference to a back end with the role of a client in the WebSocket
communication. Browser clients must use the native
[`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)
object. To make the same code work seamlessly on Node.js and the browser, you
can use one of the many wrappers available on npm, like
[isomorphic-ws](https://github.com/heineiuo/isomorphic-ws).
